##    Development of Finite Element Code to find elastic constants of Nanocomposite
Developed a finite element code for analysing a nanocomposite composed of polystyrene matrix and graphene nanoparticles. I used a 2-D analysis approach to determine Young's moduli Ex and Ey in the x and y-directions. The project involved modelling circular graphene particles arranged in both square and diamond arrays, conducting two variants of analysis to assess mechanical properties with precision.
